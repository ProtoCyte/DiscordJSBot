# Discord JS Bot Created By ProtoCyte

This is a Discord Bot created by me. I used the Discord Framework to do most things, and relied 
on a simple command handler from a Youtube Tutorial I found online. It's a simple bot with only a few commands which
I tried to base of similar commands from Nightbot from Twitch.

## Some of the Commands/Features
- [x] Bulk Delete A channel's messages
- [x] Magic 8Ball
- [x] Create Text/Voice channels 
- [x] Server Info 
- [x] Pick between a list of items
- [x] React to Messages to get roles 
- [ ] Order Your Coffee
- [ ] Predict the Lottery Numbers

Other commands are in the repository
